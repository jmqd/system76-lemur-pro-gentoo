Gentoo on the System76 Lemur Pro (lemp9)
========================================

I have a fully functional install of Gentoo Linux on my System76 Lemur Pro
(lemp9). This is a collection of configurations, kernel compilation files, and
other artifacts that may be helpful to others compiling a linux distro from
scratch onto their lemp9.

.Caveats
* I have an nvme4 drive. If your system differs, adjust accordingly.
* Some of these settings may be unique to choices I made, e.g. drive partitions,
formatting (btrfs), etc. Proceed with diligence.

The primary use case I see here for others is to `diff` my
`kernel_compilation_config` with theirs, to see if they're missing any modules
or drivers (e.g. `iwlwifi`).
